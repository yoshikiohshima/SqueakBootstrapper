===============================================================================

SqueakBootstrapper is the first step to create a Squeak image from "text files."
It is an MIT-licensed project.

The idea consists of a few parts:

  - A very small image (~120k), derived from MicroSqueak by John
    Maloney with minimum capability of loading pre-compiled class
    definitions and methods is serialized to an array embedded in a C
    file.

  - The BootstrapCompiler, a Squeak Bytecode Compiler written in C
    (and leg originally by Ian Piumarata), which can generate the
    pre-compiled files from regular Squeak Smalltalk file outs.

  - A "reference implementation" of above compiler, written in
    OMeta2/Squeak.  This produces the bit-identical binary file with
    the above compiler.

  - A mildly shrunk-down but otherwise regular Squeak Compiler.

  - A host Squeak image that can create the MicroSqueak image above
    and development.

The bootstrap process goes like this:

  0. The MicroSqueak image is created from the development image, and
     the result is rendered to a C file that contains the content of
     entire file as an "unsigned char" array.  We pretend that this
     file is given.  This image is equipped with "BootStrapReader",
     which can read an external file format called ".sto" from file.

  1. The BootstrapCompiler in C reads the definition of the Squeak
     Compiler written in Squeak, and generates the .sto (called
     "compiler.sto") file.

  2. The MicroSqueak reads compiler.sto and save itself.  Now, this
     image can further read more code and compile them.

  3. As the first step, compile the same Squeak Compiler code by
     itself.

  4. It now can read more files, including doits.

  5. Theoretically, it can go up to the full image.

Currently, only 0. through 3 are working.

I/ Installation
---------------

  First install my version of "greg" from
https://github.com/yoshikiohshima/greg .

  This version of greg (which is a minor variation of leg) is equipped
with the memoization feature, which is essential to parse non-trivial
amount of code.  Place the greg directory by this repository.

  Type "make test" in this repository.  The "image.c" is generated
from the MicroSqueak image but put in the repo.  The command created
from image.c creates a .image file, the compiler source code is turned
to .sto file and it is loaded into the image.

II/ What is it good for?
-------------------------

  - A separated copmiler implementation and class hierarchy lets
    people who want to do a deep change to Squeak without shooting
    your own foot.

  - A long-standing problem of not being able to create the image from
    text files may be now solvable.

  - A clean starting point that can grow may give you a fresh
    opportunity to redesign the entire system.

  - A C-based compiler is blazingly fast.  Compiling the 150k of code
    takes less than half-second.  Loading the .sto file is also quite
    fast.  This format alone may have some other use (i.e., a
    lightweight persistent/code migration).

III/ Limitations
-----------------

  - The Bootstrap Compilers generates less efficient bytecode sequence
    than the regular compiler.  It does not produces storeintopop
    instructions (other than the initialization of block temps).  It
    also has a limitation of number of literal variables in a method.
    (This is why the initialize methods of VariableNode and ParseNode
    are split into a few.)  The generated methods always use big
    contexts.

  - The compilers are not closure-aware.

  - The class builder in the image does not support class mutation,
    but only addition of new classes.

  - The entry point #start method is intended to be "clean" over image
    saving; i.e., when the image is saved, it schedules the new
    process that should be launched freshly in the new session but the
    process that saved the image is supposed to cleanly go away.  In
    other words, if you keep loading the same methods and
    save-and-quit the image over and over again, the image size should
    stay exactly the same.  But there is a context object or two
    accumulating every cycle.

  - The development image is not a standard version.  It is
    3.8-derived, but some changes from trunk are brought into it.
    Also, the dictionary that is used by the other parts of dev-image
    and MicroSqueak hierarchy are different; this tends to cause
    troubles.

III/ Development
-----------------

  You (still) need the development image:

http://tinlizzie.org/~ohshima/SqueakBootstrapper.zip

With this, you would add more classes to the MObject hierarchy and try
to test things there.  There is MTestCase class so it is a good idea
to write some tests, as the ability of interactive debugging is often
limited.

You can generate a new MicroSqueak image with your change, but also
file out your code to .st and create a .sto file, and load it by
giving the file name to the command line argument of Squeak
invocation.  (The third argument of the command line specifies whether
the image should be saved at the end or not.)

III/ Plans
----------------------

  - Adapt closure compiler.

  - Add more features for supporting self-development.

  - Clean up the MicroSqueak hiearachy again to make the image smaller
    and cleaner.

  - Do something with the big C array idea.  We could have a even
    smaller image that can load binary (it could be somewhat like
    Spoon), or we could capture the dynamic behavior of
    MicroSqueakImageBuilder and store the sequence of image writing
    commands in, say, C.  Then we could "replay" the commands to
    create the image file.
